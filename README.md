Hello! I’m Joey, a business analytics student with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable strategies that drive growth and innovation. My journey has taken me from hands-on roles in hospitality and operations to strategic consulting, where I’ve helped businesses navigate challenges and unlock new opportunities.

During my 10 years in the hospitality industry, I witnessed firsthand how data—or the lack of it—can make or break a business. From the pandemic’s upheaval to everyday operational hurdles, I saw how companies with a data-driven approach not only survived but thrived. This inspired me to begin consulting for F&B peers, using insights to optimize their strategies. At Uni-Tat Ice & Marketing, I translated this into action by launching an e-commerce platform that increased monthly revenue by 6%, while at Operation Dagger, I revitalized a World’s 50 Best Bars contender through creative branding and data-backed decision-making. Earlier, as Restaurant Manager at Native, I pivoted during COVID-19 by introducing an e-commerce arm, proving that agility and analytics go hand in hand.

Now, I’m sharpening my expertise further by pursuing a degree in Global Business Management and a Specialist Diploma in Business Analytics & Applied Science, with a focus on Python, SQL, and visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. My goal? To bridge the gap between numbers and narrative—helping businesses turn data into clarity, strategy, and results.

Fluent in English and Mandarin, with conversational Spanish and Japanese, I thrive in collaborative, multicultural settings. Whether it’s optimizing operations, uncovering market trends, or crafting a compelling story from datasets, I’m driven by the belief that the right insight at the right time can change everything.

Let’s connect and explore how data can elevate your business—I’d love to hear your story!
